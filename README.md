My progress in kottans frontend course

## Git and GitHub

In the first self-study part I finished the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)
My final progress is in attach below:

I'm really proud of completing this useful course, because I acquired there a lot of skills such as:

* Making commits 
* Cloning and exploring repositories
* Learning basic git commands
* Acquainting with concept map
* Learning how to write good commit messages
* Working with branches
* Working with merging
* Making pull requests

Also I began to read and analyze information in [try.github.io/](http://try.github.io/)

Thanks organizers for interesting additional materials! Look forward to learn materials from the next lessons :) 


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

![Course progress](https://github.com/kalash14/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_linux_cli/1.png)

After completing course 'Learn the Command Line', reading articles about HTTP and reading extra-materials I learned:

* How to use basic commands to navigate in file systems, files manipulations, configuring the environment etc.
* How to use aliases which can help me to save my time in future
* Using of base HTTP methods
* Using instruments which were a little obsolete but anyway could describe basic concepts :) 
* HTTP state codes which also can help me to debug my apps in future
* HTTP headers, messages, responses, requests

Majority of information was not new for me, but for example, knowledge of HTTP caching was new and very interesting.
Knowledge of networking is very important for frontend devs, so I also started completing course 'Networking for Web Developers'.
