I'm really proud of completing this useful course, because I acquired there a lot of skills such as:

* Making commits 
* Cloning and exploring repositories
* Learning basic git commands
* Acquainting with concept map
* Learning how to write good commit messages
* Working with branches
* Working with merging
* Making pull requests

Also I began to read and analyze information in [try.github.io/](http://try.github.io/)

Thanks organizers for interesting additional materials! Look forward to learn materials from the next lessons :) 


## Linux CLI, and HTTP

After completing course 'Learn the Command Line', reading articles about HTTP and reading extra-materials I learned:

* How to use basic commands to navigate in file systems, files manipulations, configuring the environment etc.
* How to use aliases which can help me to save my time in future
* Using of base HTTP methods
* Using instruments which were a little obsolete but anyway could describe basic concepts :) 
* HTTP state codes which also can help me to debug my apps in future
* HTTP headers, messages, responses, requests

Majority of information was not new for me, but for example, knowledge of HTTP caching was new and very interesting.
Knowledge of networking is very important for frontend devs, so I also started completing course 'Networking for Web Developers'.  

## Git Collaboration

I have completed the course 'What is Version Control'.
Most of information there is not new for me, but I learned new commands and principles in Git , such as reverting and resetting commits and also worked with command and flags to this operations.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I have finished the course 'Intro to HTML & CSS (Eng)'. Nothing new for me was there, because I am working with creating layouts for more than 2 years, but to my mind for beginners it is nice course to learn basics of building web page layouts.

Series of courses of HTML Academy: "Basics of HTML" & "Basics of CSS" I also have completed and all materials were also not new for me, but after completing these courses I would like to thank authors, because courses information was very easy to understand and I also can say that after completing this course people who don't know anything about HTML/CSS before, can create complex layouts of different web pages.

## Responsive Web Design

I have completed the course Responsive Web Design Fundamentals. It was very interesting, especially in making responsive tables and responsive web design patterns.

Also I finished very interesting Flexbox Froggy tutorial with tasks. To my mind, mini-courses like this are the most interesting and simple in studying, because all examples there were with amazing illustrations. It was really helpful to understand basics of flexbox technique instead of dozens of boring articles :)

## JS Basics

I have completed the course Intro to JS. There were a lot of interesting examples with donuts and exercises for understanding how to works with arrays and objects. It's very important fundamentals for working with JavaScript or any programming language.

Freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges were amazing!!! These tasks were the most interesting and the hardest for me in this course, because they need to summarize all my knowledge about basics of JS.
After completing this tasks I have got good skills with string and array methods such as indexOf and charAt, also I have practiced with case/switch construction, conditionals and 'for' loops.
Also I learned that we can use 'arguments' special variable for working with all function arguments. 
After completing these challenges I have got more confidence in algorithms tasks and it's really cool!!!
