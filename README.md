My progress in kottans frontend course

I'm really proud of completing this useful course, because I acquired there a lot of skills such as:

* Making commits 
* Cloning and exploring repositories
* Learning basic git commands
* Acquainting with concept map
* Learning how to write good commit messages
* Working with branches
* Working with merging
* Making pull requests

Also I began to read and analyze information in [try.github.io/](http://try.github.io/)

Thanks organizers for interesting additional materials! Look forward to learn materials from the next lessons :)
